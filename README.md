# TIS-Design-Thinking-Project

Presentation Slides and Report

What the assignment was about

This assignment involved developing a low-fidelity prototype for BuddyUp, a senior–junior support application designed to help first-year students adapt academically and socially. The prototype focused on identifying student problems and proposing features such as mentorship matching, research hubs, discussion forums, and support tools.

What I learned / gained

From this assignment, I learned how design thinking helps transform real user problems into practical digital solutions. I gained insight into understanding user pain points, defining clear problem statements, and designing features that directly address student needs such as access to study materials, senior guidance, and academic support.

Skills developed

-Problem-solving skills – identifying real challenges faced by first-year students

-Design thinking skills – applying empathy, ideation, and prototyping

-UI/UX awareness – designing simple and user-friendly prototype screens

-Team collaboration – working together to propose features and improvements

Problems faced

One challenge was deciding which features were essential and which were secondary, as there were many possible solutions. Another difficulty was ensuring the prototype remained simple while still clearly communicating the app’s functionality and purpose.

Suggestions for improvement

The prototype could be improved by adding session scheduling features, improving notification reminders, and simplifying the interface for new users. Conducting usability testing with actual first-year students would also help refine the design.
